## Brief description
This repository contains four jupyter notebooks that were used to solve some tasks for my school's student's council. They were a chance to explore a little more Python libraries such as *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *openpyexl* and *smtplib*. I used them to automate emails, analize data from google forms, and to create graphs.
